    <div class="details">
      This week, abolitionist elder Angela Davis amplified the call for organized resistance to Darren Walker’s attempt to tame our movements. We call on Ford Fellows, funded organizations, all our grassroots comrades and those who wish to challenge the hegemony of the non-profit to join us in demonstrating our strength. We will gather at this location to rally against the defanging and neutralizing of movements who would co-opt rather than collaborate for true progress. <br><br>

      Ms. Davis' statement, excerpted:
      "I didn't want us to forget that the brother asked the question about how to respond to a very burning issue, when a formation like Ford Foundation which is known to have funded so many progressive organizations and scholars, legitimizes this effort to completely cancel out the impact of calling for the closing of Rikers island...*people uncertainly clap*, and um maybe somebody needs to organize some kind of a demonstration because the Ford building is right here in New York, I mean I’ve been there, and I would actually be willing to join. Thank you so much for raising the question, this is the kind of work we will have to do if we want to continue to make abolitionist ideas available to masses of people in this country." <br><br><br><br>
