      <div class="details">
        On Nov.1st, 2,000 of us took the streets of Brooklyn to warn De Blasio, Cuomo, and their lapdog army the NYPD that we wasn’t playing fucking games with them no more! We drew a line in the fucking sand. That we refuse to tolerate their
        escalation of violence against poor people, against the black, brown, indigenous, undocumented, and trans folk on the streets and in our subways.<br><br>
        We said FUCK YOUR $2.75! Cops out of the MTA! We said No new jails on stolen land. We said you got 11 billion for new jails?! You got it to repair NYCHA and free transit!<br><br>
        WE MEANT THAT SHIT! This city, from Brooklyn to Harlem and beyond is at war with its own people. Denying us housing while you build luxury condos, new museum wings, and jails. Hiring an army of pigs to beat us down and harass us in the
        subways cuz we can’t pay. Now, they hired Dermont Shea who is the bastard behind the gang database as the new police commissioner. His work will be used to sweep all of the youth off our blocks en masse. WE SAY FUCK THAT!<br><br><br><br>
