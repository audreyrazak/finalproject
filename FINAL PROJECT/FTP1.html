<div class="details">
On Friday afternoon in Brooklyn, the NYPD went hunting for black & brown youth on the subway. On the Franklin avenue stop, 19 yr old Adrian Napier was held at gun point by a gang of police aiming their weapons through the subway cart windows as commuters screamed and ran for cover. On the Jay street Metrotech stop, NYPD repeatedly punched multiple teens in the face, tackling them to the ground. In the Bronx the week prior, Allan Feliz, Antonio Williams, and Victor Hernandez were killed by police. <br><br>

City council votes in favor of building 8-12 new jails in this city and the escalation of violence and death upon poor and working class black & brown people is felt immediately!<br><br>

WE SAY HELL NO! <br><br>

We will not accept the appeasement of politicians who vote for cages and then issue statements calling for lukewarm investigations. Who make backdoor deals with police unions!<br><br>

HELL NO! <br><br>

We will not allow crony non profits to play middleman reformist between the people and the police state while cashing checks from foundations who endorse cages!<br><br>

HELL NO!<br><br>

We will not accept your concerted effort to disappear us. Whether through rigged rezonings and gentrification or through Police murder and incarceration!<br><br>

WE SAY HELL FUCKING NO! <br><br>

The poor & working class people of this city are fucking tired of this shit! You will not erase us!!<br><br>

ON RISK â€”  || Park gathering area is low risk. More will be said day of and risks will be made clear. So come. Bring friends. More, better, stronger.<br><br><br><br>
